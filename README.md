# Overview of the Report

This repository contains a paper investigating homeless youth in the flow of shelter systems and permanent housing from 2018 to 2022. Through examining the Toronto Shelter System Flow data set from the Open Data Toronto Portal, I use this data to analyze the trends of youth experiencing homelessness and their flow between being situated in shelters and being situated in stable housing. This data is can be found on the same portal. I particularly look into these trends during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic within the provided 5-year period, which would be from 2020 to 2022. The findings of this paper are that permanent housing became less accessible to youths in a state of homelessness, unfortunately making their journey in the pandemic even worse than before.
